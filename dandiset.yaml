description: "A two photon calcium imaging dataset from Allen Institute measuring
  responses to full-field drifting gratings (approx. 120x90 degrees of visual space)
  of 8 directions and 6 contrasts (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%). Mouse Cre lines expressing
  GCaMP6f were imaged to record responses of   pyramidal neurons across cortical layers
  (Cux2: layer 2/3; Rorb: layer 4; Rbp4: layer 5; Ntsr1: layer 6) as well as inhibitory
  interneurons (Vip and Sst). All experimental sessions took place on the same data
  collection pipeline as the Allen Brain Observatory (see http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding)
  and have the same visual stimulus monitor calibration and positioning, two photon
  imaging systems and image processing pipeline, and running wheel to track locomotion.\n\n
